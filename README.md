# MERA_Image_Classification
## Code Contributor: Fanjie Kong
#### Finished Work:
1. Implemented 2D MERA model using PyTorch and TensorFlow. TensorFlow version is more time-efficient.
2. Tested our 2D MERA model on MNIST, NeedleMNIST(64x64, 128x128) and LIDC dataset. 
| Attempt | #1  | #2  |
| ------- | --- | --- |
| Seconds | 301 | 283 |

* Basic Pytorch dependency
* Tested on Pytorch 1.3, Python 3.6 
* Unzip the data and point the path to --data_path
* How to run tests: python train.py --data_path data_location

# Inverse deisng for meta-material using deep learning
## Author: Ben Ren

### This is a transfering repo from the idlm_Ben which is in tensorflow into the current Pytorch version.

#### There would be 5 models in this repo
#### Finished Models:
1. forward model (The christian's model mapping from geometry to spectra) 
2. Backpropagation model
3. Tandem model
4. Variational Auto-Encoder model
5. Convolutional Generative Adverserial Network model

#### Models working now:
1. Invertible Neural Network

#### Models to be worked on:

Please see into the folder of each model and see the README file for developer log for more details of the progress.
